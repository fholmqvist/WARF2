game\generation.go:17:
	Replace all inlined
	allocations to function
	calls, not only in this file.

game\saveload.go:17:
	This is horribly wasteful.
	Rewrite to a better format.

job\carrying.go:48:
	Obviously not great.

job\job.go:17:
	This interface is crap.
	In fact, jobs in general
	need to be revamped.
	Expand WorkStates to include
	more types of walking so that
	we can simplify mid-work walking
	logic and generally just remove
	this crap interface.

jobservice\check_for_job.go:55:
	Handle more than rocks.

jobservice\check_for_job.go:62:
	FloorBrick is _not_ an
	adequate definition of storage.

jobservice\check_for_job.go:90:
	Handle more than rocks.

jobservice\check_for_job.go:111:
	FloorBrick is _not_ an
	adequate definition of storage.

jobservice\check_for_job.go:133:
	After having harvested all tiles,
	there should be a new job 'SowFarm'
	to restart the farm again.

mouse\mouse.go:5:
	Perhaps this entire system
	should be baked into UI?
	There are cross concerns here
	where the UI now has mouse-over
	and click functionality of its own,
	splitting and duplicating efforts.

mouse\mouse.go:65:
	Setting and deleting rooms
	removes items that are
	already there.

mouse\mouse.go:110:
	Overlays, placeholders, highlights...

room\storage.go:12:
	If the storage is filled
	with StorageTiles that
	aren't maxxed, we should
	cleanup so that we have
	fewer yet filled tiles.
	This opens more slots and
	prevents storages from being
	artificially full due to
	saturation of one specific tile.
	Now, bad:
	[1 Rock, 2 Rock, 1 Rock, 4 Rock]
	Later, good:
	[4 Rock, 4 Rock,   None,   None]

room\storage.go:73:
	This just picks a random
	available storetile and
	drops it there.
	Perhaps it would be cooler
	if the dwarf moves to the
	new destination.

room\storage_tile.go:19:
	Switch amount on
	resource type.

ui\elements.go:51:
	Height does nothing.

worldmap\generation.go:74:
	New feature:
	Filling a room of the same type
	should merge the two rooms,
	extending the first.
