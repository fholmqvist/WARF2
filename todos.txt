dwarf\dwarf.go:72:
	This shouldn't happen.

game\saveload.go:17:
	This is horribly wasteful.
	Rewrite to a better format.

globals\items.go:153:
	Support more than Wheat.

job\carrying.go:58:
	Yeah.

job\carrying.go:76:
	Item is no longer there, abort.
	What should we actually do here?

jobservice\check_for_job.go:57:
	FloorBrick is _not_ an
	adequate definition of storage.

jobservice\check_for_job.go:102:
	FloorBrick is _not_ an
	adequate definition of storage.

jobservice\check_for_needs.go:24:
	FindNearestBeds (plural).
	Don't rest in occupied bed.

mouse\mouse.go:5:
	Perhaps this entire system
	should be baked into UI?
	There are cross concerns here
	where the UI now has mouse-over
	and click functionality of its own,
	splitting and duplicating efforts.

mouse\mouse.go:68:
	Setting and deleting rooms
	removes items that are
	already there.
	Change: Room needs to be empty.

room\delete.go:9:
	Are you beginning to smell an abstraction?

room\delete.go:58:
	Don't delete items in storage.

room\service.go:76:
	Should be ID, not IDX.

room\storage.go:12:
	If the storage is filled
	with StorageTiles that
	aren't maxxed, we should
	cleanup so that we have
	fewer yet filled tiles.
	This opens more slots and
	prevents storages from being
	artificially full due to
	saturation of one specific tile.
	Now, bad:
	[1 Rock, 2 Rock, 1 Rock, 4 Rock]
	Later, good:
	[4 Rock, 4 Rock,   None,   None]

room\storage_tile.go:19:
	Switch amount on
	resource type.

ui\elements.go:51:
	Height does nothing.

worldmap\generation.go:74:
	New feature:
	Filling a room of the same type
	should merge the two rooms,
	extending the first.
