entity\items.go:238:
	Support more than Wheat.

game\saveload.go:17:
	This is horribly wasteful.
	Rewrite to a better format.

job\carrying.go:58:
	Yeah.

job\carrying.go:76:
	Item is no longer there, abort.
	What should we actually do here?

jobservice\check_for_job.go:57:
	FloorBrick is _not_ an
	adequate definition of storage.

jobservice\check_for_job.go:136:
	FloorBrick is _not_ an
	adequate definition of storage.

jobservice\check_for_needs.go:37:
	FindNearestBeds (plural).
	Don't rest in occupied bed.

mouse\mouse.go:5:
	Perhaps this entire system
	should be baked into UI?
	There are cross concerns here
	where the UI now has mouse-over
	and click functionality of its own,
	splitting and duplicating efforts.

room\service.go:76:
	Should be ID, not IDX.

room\storage.go:14:
	If the storage is filled
	with StorageTiles that
	aren't maxxed, we should
	cleanup so that we have
	fewer yet filled tiles.
	This opens more slots and
	prevents storages from being
	artificially full due to
	saturation of one specific tile.
	Now, bad:
	[1 Rock, 2 Rock, 1 Rock, 4 Rock]
	Later, good:
	[4 Rock, 4 Rock,   None,   None]

room\storage_tile.go:12:
	Remove and just use regular tiles.
	Code duplication, accidental
	complexity and broken hovering.

room\storage_tile.go:25:
	Switch amount on
	resource type.

ui\elements.go:57:
	Height does nothing.

worldmap\generation.go:74:
	New feature:
	Filling a room of the same type
	should merge the two rooms,
	extending the first.
