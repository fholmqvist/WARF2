entity/items.go:204:
	job.Carrying doesn't pick these
	up if they are blocking. Extend
	it to work with blocking items
	by finding non-blocking neighbours.

entity/items.go:293:
	Support more than Wheat.

game/saveload.go:17:
	This is horribly wasteful.
	Rewrite to a better format.

job/carrying.go:43:
	Item is no longer there, abort.
	What should we actually do here?

job/carrying.go:80:
	Yeah.

jobservice/check_for_job.go:186:
	FloorBrick is _not_ an
	adequate definition of storage.

jobservice/service.go:44:
	Keep track of failed checks
	with backoff to reduce CPU
	load for complex checks that
	now fail on every frame.

mouse/mouse.go:5:
	Perhaps this entire system
	should be baked into UI?
	There are cross concerns here
	where the UI now has mouse-over
	and click functionality of its own,
	splitting and duplicating efforts.

room/bar.go:100:
	This is crap.

room/storage.go:13:
	If the storage is filled
	with StorageTiles that
	aren't maxxed, we should
	cleanup so that we have
	fewer yet filled tiles.
	This opens more slots and
	prevents storages from being
	artificially full due to
	saturation of one specific tile.
	Now, bad:
	[1 Rock, 2 Rock, 1 Rock, 4 Rock]
	Later, good:
	[4 Rock, 4 Rock,   None,   None]

room/storage_tile.go:17:
	Switch amount on
	resource type.

ui/elements.go:40:
	Height does nothing.

worldmap/generation.go:74:
	New feature:
	Filling a room of the same type
	should merge the two rooms,
	extending the first.
